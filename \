# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Problem Statement and Analysis Approach
> Data Reading/Data Understanding → Defining the path for train and test images 
- Dataset Creation→ Create train & validation dataset from the train directory with a batch size of 32. Also, resize images to 180*180.
- Dataset visualisation → Visualize one instance of all the nine classes present in the dataset 
Model Building & training : 
- Creating a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model, rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
- Choosing an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
- Training the model for ~20 epochs
- Checking if there is any evidence of model overfit or underfit.
- Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting 
> Model Building & training on the augmented data :
Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
Train the model for ~20 epochs
Write your findings after the model fit, see if the earlier issue is resolved or not?
Class distribution: Examine the current class distribution in the training dataset 
- Which class has the least number of samples?
- Which classes dominate the data in terms of the proportionate number of samples?
Handling class imbalances: Rectify class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library.
Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data :
Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model, rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
Train the model for ~30 epochs
Write your findings after the model fit, see if the issues are resolved or not?To Analyze the Lending club data set with all the information on loan given last few years and understand how some variable impacts or not towards loan success to have a loan decision made for new loans . It is important to understand the parameters which should be considered in taking loan approval decision and if some actions can be taken to secure loan customer.
### Analysis approach
- Understand credit funding parameters and factors affecting same through public knowledge and apply same on data set.
- Use EDA principles to analyse the data set 
- Clean , remove, rename and derive parameters ( columns )
- Use Data visualization methods to understand univariate and Bi variate patterns 
- Describe inferences for parameters impacting credit funding decision.


## Overfitting and ways to solve it
- 5 C of Credit – Character , Capacity, Collateral , Capital , Conditions 
- Credit score factors : Payment history-35% , Amounts owned -30%  , Credit history length (15%) , Credit mix(10%), New credits opened (10%).

## Augmentation to solve class imbalance

> The following factors were considered for Analysis and also some derivative metrices were used to arrive at the analysis.

### Business Driven Derived Metrices and other varaibles.
> For the purpose of Credit risk analysis , Credit Score or FICO score is to be calculated and also some other varaibles were derived out of given data columns.
- Since there is no Credit score given in Dataset , it would probably be a biz driven derived metric. 
> This is how Credit Score was calculated  there could be more parameters used but this is 1st version based on information gathered.

## Final results
- Credit Score and Credit utilization Ration have an important role and decision making factor to grant loans
